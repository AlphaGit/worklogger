# Configuration

The configuration system defines how the application is set up and how its components interact. It uses JSON files to specify inputs, outputs, actions, and other application settings.

## Configuration Components

- [Application Options](./app-options.md): Global settings like timezone and date formats
- [Input Configuration](./input-config.md): Settings for data sources like Google Calendar and Harvest
- [Output Configuration](./output-config.md): Settings for output destinations and formatters
- [Action Configuration](./action-config.md): Rules for modifying worklogs
- [Authentication](./auth-config.md): Credentials and tokens for external services
